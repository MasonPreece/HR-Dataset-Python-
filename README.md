This was done in Visual Studio Code using the programming language "Python." The main questions that needed to be answered are:

1. What is the overall diversity profile of the organization?
2. Can we predict who is going to terminate and who isn't? What level of accuracy can we achieve on this?
Are there areas of the company where pay is not equitable?
This code should run without any errors. The answers should be in code and through Tableau with a dashboard: [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mason.preece/viz/HRDashboard_17339147520260/HRDashboard)

I will answer the questions below:

Answer for question 1:
The overall diversity profile is as follows:

White = 187
Black or African American = 80
Asian = 29
Two or more races = 11
American Indian or Alaska Native = 3
Hispanic = 1

Answer for question 2:
It is possible to estimate who is likely to terminate. People who terminate tend to work in the Production department, where there are over 100 employees. 
Most of these employees work as Production Technicians. There are a variety of reasons for termination, such as career changes, dissatisfaction, or better pay in a different position. 
To retain employees for the long term, the company should consider:

Increasing pay.
Creating events to boost department morale.
Offering opportunities for career advancement within the company.

Answer for question 3:
Different areas of the company have varying tasks and responsibilities, so pay differs across positions and departments.

For example, a Network Engineer is not paid as much as other positions in the company despite the significant tasks and responsibilities they handle. 
On average, a Network Engineer makes $95,360 per year, but this company pays only $61,605.
